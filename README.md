# Custom-Password-Generator
Unit 5 Challenge: 
Creat a Random Passworsd Generate that takes user input

## User Requirements

1) Get user Input for Length & Character Types
2) Check that User Input Meets Minimum Requirements <br>
    a. Length between 8 & 128 <br>
    b. At least one character type selected
3) Create a random password using selected characters and length
4) Display that password to the screen

## Problems Solved

1) Creating a new array of Characters based on user input
2) Getting the user input via a model form instead of multiple prompts to create a more user friendly experience
3) While the length input does make it possible to type in an incorrect value, this will still generate an alert asking for a valid number
4) Getting a boolean for each character checkbox <br >
    a. ! NOTE - I need to assign checkboxes a value of false before checking  form otherwise value remains true for every password until page refreshed.

### Project Overview

Lots of unforseen difficulties. Working with checkboxes and modals definitely had me thinking I should have stuck with prompts for user input but I very much wanted a more user friendly input. 
Took a bit work to get the modal to display without scroll bars on smaller screens. In future I thinkit would be better to develop for the moble view first then scale up.  

### Final Result
